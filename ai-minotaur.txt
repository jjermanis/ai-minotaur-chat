Create a single-page app in a single HTML file with the following requirements:
- Name: Minotaur
- Goal: Get your character through the maze.
- The maze is placed in a square cell grid. There are 50 dimensions: 8x8, 10x10, 16x16, 20x20, 25x25. 
- These grid levels are played in order, starting with 8x8.
- The entrance is at the upper-left corner of the grid.
- The exit is at the lower-right corner of the grid.
- To create the maze on each game, it uses the Depth First Search. The elements that block paths in the maze are referred to as walls.
- Every square in the maze should be reachable, due to completion of Depth First Search.
- At the top of screen and centered is the game title: "MINOTAUR".
- For the layout of the screen, there are two maps in the middle of the screen.
- There are two maps shown on the screen. They are different views of the same map.
- The map on the right is a 2D view of the map. The view looks like a typical 2D map. The ground is green like grass. The walls are red like bricks.
- The map on the left is a 3D view of the map. The ground is green grass. The walls are red bricks. The skies are blue.
- The modal dialog allows the size of the cell grid to be changed.
- There is a button below the lower-right corner of the 2D view. It is labeled "Reset Maze". It is displayed the player exits the current map.
- Controls are based on the 2D view on the right.
- The player of the game is a gray arrow. The tip of the arrow points forward.
- At the beginning, players will not see the entire maze on the 2D grid. At the beginning, all the squares show as gray.
- If you can see some of a grid square in the 3D view, it will appear on the 2D view.
- If the player types the left arrow, the arrow turns 90 degrees to the left.
- If the player types the right arrow, the arrow turns 90 degrees to the right.
- If the player types the up arrow, if there is not a wall in the way, it moves one square in the direction it points.
- The map on the left is a 3D view of the map. The ground is green grass. The walls are red bricks. The skies are blue.
- On the 3D view of the map, the point of view is from the gray arrow. You cannot see the arrow in the picture - it is the arrow's point of view.
- On the 3D view of the map, the point of view from the gray arrow is 5 feet tall. The red brick walls are 10 feet tall.
- On the 3D view of the map, the walls are brightest closest to the arrow. The farther away the wall is from the arrow, the dimmer the wall is shown.
- The external walls (bottom and right) on the exit grid are colored green.
- When the arrow comes to the exit grid, the center below the views says: You Escape! The arrow is no longer seen.
- When the arrow comes to the exit grid, the Reset Maze button is visible.
- Clicking the Reset Maze button starts the next level. A new maze is generated, the arrow moves the upper-left corner, the Reset Maze button is hidden.
