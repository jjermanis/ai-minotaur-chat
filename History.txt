Version 00.01	10 minutes dev	2 minutes code gen	3 minutes test		15 minutes total

The starting basis for this Minotaur game is Maze Game. I don't mean theoretically - I mean that
will be the source. For this version, we will start with the existing base app, then make some
minor changes to trivially match the new app.
I presented the app description of Maze Game first. It provided feedback on what
it thought it saw. It did decent analysis the text description. Not super useful: the game 
itself has more details that are not documented. It understood well, and didn't suggested
changes, which is good, since it would have been inaccurate.
I presented the app itself. This is did seem to understand well. It made some assumption on how
the game would be completed. That was largely wrong - not horrible, but not really an issue.
I will tell it what we'll implement.
The first step will be to remove the UI for changing the map size. Having UI for that is not 
part of this game. We will change the size, but it will be part of the game: map gets larger
as the player advances. That was a fairly substantial change: many variables and functions
were no longer valid. There was one defect (of a function call left behind) but easily fixed.
The next step is to remove the Reset Maze button. I suppose that could have been retained.
But I want it to look different. For this one, the logic behind the button exists, but only
shows after the maze is exited. The button will be shown. If pressed, the game it restart
(new map, player starts at top-left) and the button goes away again.
That's it for now. Minotaur functionals will start next.

One change is to introduce automatic level climbing. The list of levels goes from 3 to 5.
Minotaur starts on the first level. When the player gets to the escape, when you reset, it goes 
one level forward. When you exit on the last cave level, it says "You Win!" Chat was asked to do
this. There were a substantial number of changes, but all were simple. Chat was a bit odd: in
their reply, some was valid source code, and some was pseudo. Easy enough to follow.
The other change was to add a MINOTAUR game title to the top of the screen. This was simple:
the text, the format, and a list of fonts to use (depending on the user has available). Quick
and easy.


Version 00.03	15 minutes dev	 1 minutes code gen	3 minutes test		53 minutes total

A long standing issue that needed adjustment: even as the scale of the maze changes, the player
size does not change at all. This is minor, but does not look quite right - the arrow should
change in scale in proportion to the maze cells. I asked Chat for the change. It did it quick and
easy, no issues.
The first truly new feature: adding the Minotaur to the screen. The first step: present the 
Minotaur in the 2D map. No action, no motion - just testing a model for the UI. I described a
model for the Minotaur. The first implementation has small horns. Asked for a smaller head and
longer spiky horns. The second implementation looks like a cartoon mouse. I provided more tweaks.
The third implementation REALLY looked like a cute cartoon masks. I started with a new description:
horns start straight to the side and point up. That was a lot better. Too big though: it would 
extended through walls. This made it easy to tweak: I edited the variables to make it fit well.
Not ideal... but a good starting point.
Next, we start with the implementation within the game. Initially, all the UI changes in 2D.
Adding to 3D is after that.


Version 00.04	12 minutes dev	1 minutes code gen	2 minutes test		1 hour 8

To lead off, we start to implement the Minotaur behavior as intended. There is a timer based
on the size of the grid. The timer starts when the players moves off their first square in 
the grid. 
Let's say the maze is 10x10. After half the size in seconds (in this case, 5 seconds), the 
Minotaur appears in the  upper-left corner, the same as the start of the plater. When the time 
matches the size (10 seconds)... well, it will eventually chase the player, but for now, the
Minotaur moves to (1,1). All of this UI is in the 2D grid. 
Chat provided the code for this. It worked... but did not reset the Minotaur location at the 
end of a level. That was easy to spot and to fix. Now it behaves as expected for each level.


Version 00.05	25 minutes dev	1 minute code gen	4 minutes test		1 hour 38

Starting off action in the game: got the Minotaur moving to chase the player. I had a thought
for how the Minotaur would follow the player (Breadth First Search). I did not share this 
thought. Nonetheless, that's what it recommended. I ask Chat to implement.
It had some significant defects. It referenced variables that did not exist in the code. I 
fixed that manually. After that, every path to the Minotaur to the player had a length of
zero. I debugged to find the issue. There were two bugs. It referenced the wrong element 
within the maze data. Also, the order the directions of neighbors did not match in order.
I fixed this manually. That worked! There are two minor defects - I will address that next.


Version 00.06	6 minutes dev	0 minutes code gen	3 minutes test		1 hour 47

As stated in the last version, two small defects were added for the large change made to 
move the Minotaur.
One of the minor defects was that the Minotaur moved as soon as it appeared. It was supposed
to do that after it waits after appearance. I expected a one-line code. It renamed the variable
in its place to be more clear. Still easy
The second is that after the player escapes, the Minotaur still moves. When the player exits, 
everything should stop on that level. Easy one line change... with a nasty trick. This
turns the Minotaur movement off... then MinotaurTimer runs again, turning it back on. I
added a check in updateMinotaurTimer to not run when the player exits.
The game suggested setting a game state from playing to won (or lost or paused) I don't see that now,
but maybe with more changes.


Version 00.07	18 minutes dev	1 minutes code gen	8 minutes test		2 hours 14

Now we add a new form of special effect: the Minotaur talks. When he first appears (on each
level) he says "awake". When he starts moving, he says "go." If the Minotaur captures the 
player, he says "eat. eat." This was done by trying several voices (with the help of Chat)
to find scary voice. A list is provided of the preferred voices to use. The volume and speed
are adjusted. A function is created to create the speaking voice. Finally, the easy part,
the voice is uttered when the activities in the game occur.
This took some effort. On the upside, no defects along the way.


Version 00.08	12 minutes dev	2 minutes code gen	4 minutes test		2 hours 32

We will add the last voice for now. For each level, the first time the Minotaur can see a player
(no peaking through the wall), it will say "food." I expected this to be the most challenging.
And it was more tricky than expected. 
I provided detailed rules to Chat. For it's first attempt, it based it around Bresenham's line
algorithm. It short: for sure it is the wrong algorithm. I'd put Bresenham and what's needed in 
the same category (calculating lines on a grid), but it is not at all useful to solve the 
problem (is there a line between Point A and B). To confirm, I tried using this. Not even
close.
I pointed at an existing algorithm that is similar. Along a line, we need to see how far it
goes before it collides. I pointed at the existing code (draw3D and castRay) that uses this.
I provided it to Chat. It was a similar outcome: the result was not at all close.
For lack of a better explanation, I think Chat was confused. I gave it a copy of the source
for 00.07. I asked it to create a solution based on the previous paragraph (using a similar
algorithm). Surprising as it might sound that totally work: no new description of the requested
change was needed. An updated source of the code was the difference maker.
We have 2D graphics and sound. Next is 3D graphics.


Version 00.09	24 minutes	3 minute code gen	3 minutes test		3 hours 2

Now, time to start adding the Minotaur to the 3D view. To start, it starts and remains at
the upper-left corner. For now, the Minotaur will not move. Finally, it will always draw
the Minotaur, even blocked by walls. This to keep it simple (relatively speaking).
There were several defects. 
The first is that the point-of-view by the Minotaur is off by 90 degrees. Specifically, 
90 degrees to the left. I asked Chat to address. It was able to resolve: a value adjust to 
an angle by PI/2 (aka 90 degrees) was needed. Simple change and it worked.
The second issue was that the transparency was done oddly. Inside the Minotaur's body, many 
cells are transparent. It was not desired, not good when deployed to the 3D map. On the 
flipside, none of the black background in that image is transparent... so it is shown as a 
black background around it. I told Chat about the transparency mistakes. It fixed on the 
first attempt.
The third issue was that the Minotaur was based on being laid out in the center of the
screen. This does not look right, especially as you get distance: it's more like the
Minotaur is floating. I asked Chat to address this. It made it better... but not perfect.
The resolution was with the image itself. Chat was balancing the image. The was some white
space, which in effect still had some white space. I edited the PNG file to get rid of the
majority of the white space underneath. This was much better - to an extent, it floats
but minor. Fixes will take a big of work: the real based should be a bit up in the image, 
between the feet. But this is subtle and works now.
This was exciting to see. Next step: have the walls block the view of the Minotaur in 3D
mode, and get the Minotaur moving again (in both 2D and 3D).



TODO: The speed will be passed on the level. The higher the level, the faster the speed.
TODO: When it can first see the player, it says "food". 
TODO: There is a quirk for setting the level after getting captured. In showDefeatMessage(), it
	sets the level to 4; other code sets it back to 0. See if this can be cleaned.
TODO: Let hitting Enter press the Reset Maze button.
TODO: The button should not always says Reset Maze. For example, if the player is caught, the
	button should say New Game.
TODO: Small balance defect on the 3D Minotaur. It's balancing on the bottom of the Minotaur
	image. To look better, it should balance within the image, between the feet.
Chat: create game states to an easier flow of logic. States: playing, won, lost, paused
Chat: "Display level number. Top center above maze, or inside status"
Chat: "For 2D Minotaur, Add small black eye slits"
Chat: "For 2D Minotaur, Slightly flatten bottom of skull"
Chat: "Add depth buffer"
Chat: "Clip sprite behind walls"
Chat: "True sprite column rendering"
Design "Does the Minotaur move randomly?" No, it will go to the player as quick as it can.
Design "Can the player see the Minotaur in 3D?" Yes, though not to start
Design "Is it visible only if in line-of-sight?" Yes, for 3D. 2D, always visible
Design "Is there sound?" Yes, the Minotaur will talk
Design "Is there stamina?" No. Not a bad idea, but I don't see value.
Design "Is the goal still escape" Yes
Design "Does maze regenerate per death?" Yes
