Version 00.01	10 minutes dev	2 minutes code gen	3 minutes test		15 minutes total

The starting basis for this Minotaur game is Maze Game. I don't mean theoretically - I mean that
will be the source. For this version, we will start with the existing base app, then make some
minor changes to trivially match the new app.
I presented the app description of Maze Game first. It provided feedback on what
it thought it saw. It did decent analysis the text description. Not super useful: the game 
itself has more details that are not documented. It understood well, and didn't suggested
changes, which is good, since it would have been inaccurate.
I presented the app itself. This is did seem to understand well. It made some assumption on how
the game would be completed. That was largely wrong - not horrible, but not really an issue.
I will tell it what we'll implement.
The first step will be to remove the UI for changing the map size. Having UI for that is not 
part of this game. We will change the size, but it will be part of the game: map gets larger
as the player advances. That was a fairly substantial change: many variables and functions
were no longer valid. There was one defect (of a function call left behind) but easily fixed.
The next step is to remove the Reset Maze button. I suppose that could have been retained.
But I want it to look different. For this one, the logic behind the button exists, but only
shows after the maze is exited. The button will be shown. If pressed, the game it restart
(new map, player starts at top-left) and the button goes away again.
That's it for now. Minotaur functionals will start next.

One change is to introduce automatic level climbing. The list of levels goes from 3 to 5.
Minotaur starts on the first level. When the player gets to the escape, when you reset, it goes 
one level forward. When you exit on the last cave level, it says "You Win!" Chat was asked to do
this. There were a substantial number of changes, but all were simple. Chat was a bit odd: in
their reply, some was valid source code, and some was pseudo. Easy enough to follow.
The other change was to add a MINOTAUR game title to the top of the screen. This was simple:
the text, the format, and a list of fonts to use (depending on the user has available). Quick
and easy.


Version 00.03	15 minutes dev	 1 minutes code gen	3 minutes test		53 minutes total

A long standing issue that needed adjustment: even as the scale of the maze changes, the player
size does not change at all. This is minor, but does not look quite right - the arrow should
change in scale in proportion to the maze cells. I asked Chat for the change. It did it quick and
easy, no issues.
The first truly new feature: adding the Minotaur to the screen. The first step: present the 
Minotaur in the 2D map. No action, no motion - just testing a model for the UI. I described a
model for the Minotaur. The first implementation has small horns. Asked for a smaller head and
longer spiky horns. The second implementation looks like a cartoon mouse. I provided more tweaks.
The third implementation REALLY looked like a cute cartoon masks. I started with a new description:
horns start straight to the side and point up. That was a lot better. Too big though: it would 
extended through walls. This made it easy to tweak: I edited the variables to make it fit well.
Not ideal... but a good starting point.
Next, we start with the implementation within the game. Initially, all the UI changes in 2D.
Adding to 3D is after that.



TODO: Get Minotaur to appear and start according to rules. The timer starts for each level based 
	on when players leave first square. The Minotaur starts based on size of Maze. Let's
	say the maze is 10x10. The Minotaur appears in the upper-left in 5 seconds. It will
	start moving after 10 seconds.
TODO: The Minotaur will persue player. It will always move to the player on the alternate
	path. A bredth first search will work.
TODO: The speed will be passed on the level. The higher the level, the faster the speed.
TODO: If the player and Minotaur touch, it is game over.
TODO: Add speech for Minotaur. When it appears, it says "awake". When it starts moving, it
	says "go". When it can first see the player, it says "food". If it catches the player
	it says "eat...eat"
Chat: "Display level number. Top center above maze, or inside status"
Chat: "For 2D Minotaur, Add small black eye slits"
Chat: "For 2D Minotaur, Slightly flatten bottom of skull"
Design "Does the Minotaur move randomly?" No, it will go to the player as quick as it can.
Design "Can the player see the Minotaur in 3D?" Yes, though not to start
Design "Is it visible only if in line-of-sight?" Yes, for 3D. 2D, always visible
Design "Is there sound?" Yes, the Minotaur will talk
Design "Is there stamina?" No. Not a bad idea, but I don't see value.
Design "Is the goal still escape" Yes
Design "Does maze regenerate per death?" Yes
